## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Java 11 or higher**: Required to run the Spring Boot application.
- **Maven**: For building the project and managing dependencies.
- **MongoDB**: For storing member details.
- **Lombok Plugin**: Lombok is used for reducing boilerplate code such as getters, setters, and
constructors in Java. Make sure you add the Lombok dependency to the pom.xml file and install
the Lombok plugin in your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ or Eclipse).


## Steps to Build and Run the Application

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/srinivasgowthamajeti7/Kitchensink-BE.git
cd kitchensink-api

### 2. Configure MongoDB

Ensure MongoDB is running locally on your machine. Open MongoDB Compass, Use the connection string
mongodb://localhost:27017 to connect to your local MongoDB instance.The application expects
MongoDB to be available on localhost with port 27017 and will connect to a database named
Membership_details and a collection called Member.You can modify these configurations in
the application.properties file if needed.


### 3. Build the Application

Use Maven to build the application:

mvn clean install

### 4. Run the Application

mvn spring-boot:run


5. Access the API

Once the application is running, the API will be available at http://localhost:8081/api/members.
You can interact with the following endpoints using the postman tool:

POST /api/members: Register a new member.

  "name": "gowtham majeti",
